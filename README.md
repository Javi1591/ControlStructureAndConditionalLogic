# Java Assignments 3 & 4 – Control Structures and Conditional Logic

A pair of Java console programs demonstrating decision-making and branching using **if-else statements**, **switch cases**, and **loop control structures**.  
These assignments continue building upon prior Java fundamentals while emphasizing conditional execution and user input validation.

## Assignment 3 – Decision-Making with if-else Statements

### Description
A Java console program that prompts the user for specific input (such as test scores, numeric ranges, or categories) and responds with an appropriate message or classification.  
It uses **if-else** and **nested conditionals** to evaluate multiple criteria.

### Features
- Uses `Scanner` for real-time user input.  
- Demonstrates **relational operators** (`>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`) and **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`).  
- Implements branching logic with clear, formatted console output.  
- Includes input validation and error-handling messages.  
- Illustrates Java’s top-to-bottom conditional evaluation.

### Learning Objectives
- Apply conditional logic to control program flow.  
- Understand Boolean expressions and operator precedence.  
- Practice combining relational and logical operators in expressions.

## Assignment 4 – Switch Statements and Menu-Driven Programs

### Description
A menu-driven Java application that demonstrates the use of the **`switch`** statement for multi-path decision logic.  
The program allows a user to select from various options (e.g., unit conversions, arithmetic operations, or text responses) and performs the chosen action.

### Features
- Presents a numbered or lettered menu for user selection.  
- Utilizes a `switch` statement to process menu choices efficiently.  
- Incorporates a `default` case for invalid entries.  
- May include loop repetition (`do-while`) to allow multiple user selections.  
- Demonstrates modular structure through methods or case segmentation.

### Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between `if-else` and `switch` constructs.  
- Implement case handling with `break` and `default` statements.  
- Reinforce menu-driven program design and structured flow.

### Files
- `Nazario_Assignment4.java` (example filename) – full implementation for Assignment 4.

## Program Structure

Each Java file includes:
- Proper header comments (author, date, description).  
- Organized indentation and inline documentation.  
- The `main()` method as the execution entry point.  
- Consistent naming and style matching COP2251 coursework.
